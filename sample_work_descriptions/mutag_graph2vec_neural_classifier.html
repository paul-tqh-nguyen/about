    <p>This work classifies chemical compounds based on their mutagenic effect on a particular bacterium. This work is intended to reproduce the results from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05005">graph2vec</a>. Rather than using a support vector machine as used in the original paper, we used logistic regression and a feed-forward neural network.</p>

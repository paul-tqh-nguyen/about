    <p>When selecting a model or architecture for an NLP task such as sentiment classification, it's often unclear which to select. Pretrained transformers models are a popular choice. With many pretrained models available, it's still unclear which to select. This article goes over our findings when comparing how 15 pretrained transformers models compare on the task of sentiment classification for Google Play app reviews.</p>
